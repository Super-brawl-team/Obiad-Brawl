        "reason": "You are hereby permanently banned from Brawl Stars due to severe and repeated violations of our Terms of Service. Our records indicate that you have created unauthorized private servers, manipulated game data through hacking, and actively exploited in-game bugs for personal gain. These actions not only compromise the fairness and integrity of Brawl Stars but also negatively impact the experience of millions of players who engage with our game respectfully and legitimately. Creating private servers is a direct infringement of our policies, as it bypasses our security systems, undermines the official game economy, and introduces unauthorized content that destabilizes gameplay. Hacking and modifying the game to unlock content, gain unlimited resources, or alter core mechanics is strictly prohibited and constitutes a serious breach of trust within the Brawl Stars community. Furthermore, your deliberate use of exploits rather than reporting them to us demonstrates a clear intent to gain an unfair advantage at the expense of others. As developers, we are committed to maintaining a safe, fun, and competitive environment for all players, and as such, we cannot allow these actions to go unpunished. This ban is final and will not be reversed."
