  # How to change ip and port
  
  Thanks to risporce for this amazing script, here is his method :

  1: Download the client and extract it.
  
  2: go to Payload/Brawl Stars.app/ in your file manager and start a new tab and go to this location in your terminal.
  
  3: In your file manager, you will see ipPatcher.py, open it in any text editor and locate in the first line of the script the patched_ip and patched_port variable with a string.
  
  4: Change the string to be your ipv4 address of your device you execute the server from and  the port you want if needed (default is 9339).
  
  5: After the ip (and the port) changed is saved, in your terminal with the client location, execute this following command : python ipPatcher.py
  
  6: Save and change extention back to ipa.
  
  7: Install the client using your favorite app installer and enjoy.

  # BONUS
  
   # DEBUG MENU
    You can edit "debugMenuEnabled" to enable or disable debug menu! Note : i dont use dev builds, so only few buttons work...

   # RC4 KEY
    You can also (not mendatory xd) edit the rc4 key and get a random one. Like that; peoples will have a little difficulty to steal your stuff, just set changeRC4Key to true and copy the key he provided, you will have to edit settings.json and replace the key!

   # DIFFERENT CRYPTOGRAPHY METHODS
    you can use nacl cryptography by putting "NACL" in settings.json but its only if you use this server as base for v7 or more server
